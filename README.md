# What is SURL? 🔗

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

# Why I created SURL? ✨

My only purpose for making this was so that I can make the frontend very well and I can practice as much as possible. I wanted to show my ability by making this page. I am very happy to make this and will continue to create new pages. so that i can get more knowledge about the Front-end.

Thank's 😊.
